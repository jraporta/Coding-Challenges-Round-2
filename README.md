## 🎯 Tasks

1. **Task 1**: `user-service` implementation. CRD API.
2. **Task 2**: `message-service` implementation and communication between `message-service` and `user-service`.
3. **Task 3**: `notification-service` implementation and communication between `notification-service` and `frontend-service`.


### 📑 Detailed information about tasks

#### Task 1

You must implement a set of RESTful endpoints to manage user operations. These include creating users, retrieving all users, retrieving a user by ID, and deleting users (both individually and in bulk). It is essential to implement proper HTTP status codes for each operation and adhere to the following specifications.

**Base url: http://localhost:8080**

1. **Create a New User**
- **Method**: `POST`
- **Endpoint**: `/user`
- **Request Body** (JSON):
  ```json
  {
    "name": "User Name",
    "email": "email@example.com",
    "age": 30
  }
  ```
**Status Codes**:
- 201 Created: User successfully created.
- 400 Bad Request: The request contains invalid data.

2. **Retrieve All Users**
- **Method**: `GET`
- **Endpoint**: `/user/all`
- **Status Codes**:
    - `200 OK`: Users retrieved successfully.
    - `204 No Content`: No users found.
- **Expected Response** (JSON when users exist):
    ```json
    [
    {
        "id": 1,
        "name": "User Name",
        "email": "email@example.com",
        "age": 30
    },
    {
        "id": 2,
        "name": "Another User",
        "email": "another@example.com",
        "age": 25
    }
    ]
    ```

3. **Retrieve a User by ID**
- **Method**: `GET`
- **Endpoint**: `/user/{id}`
- **Path Parameter**:
    - `id`: The ID of the user to retrieve.
- **Status Codes**:
    - `200 OK`: User retrieved successfully.
    - `404 Not Found`: No user found with the given ID.
- **Expected Response** (JSON):
    ```json
    {
        "id": 1,
        "name": "User Name",
        "email": "email@example.com",
        "age": 30
    }
    ```

4. **Delete a User by ID**
- **Method**: `DELETE`
- **Endpoint**: `/user/{id}`
- **Path Parameter**:
    - `id`: The ID of the user to delete.
- **Status Codes**:
    - `200 OK`: User deleted successfully.
    - `404 Not Found`: No user found with the given ID.

5. **Delete All Users**
- **Method**: `DELETE`
- **Endpoint**: `/user/all`
- **Status Codes**:
    - `200 OK`: All users deleted successfully.

The project to be modified for this task will be [user-service](/user-service/src/main/java/io/nuwe/technical/api/) where you can find everything you need to just add or modify the necessary code.

**In future tasks, you will need to come back here and note that a user must be subscribed to notifications by default once it is created.**

**To complete this task it will be necessary to code the .proto file for `user-service`.**

#### Task 2

**Base url for messages: http://localhost:8181**

Task 2 is focused on fixing the internal communication between microservices. Specifically, the communication between the `Messages - Service` and the `User - Service`. Something is not working as expected and a bug has stopped the software developing of the project. 

To complete this task it is necessary that the `user-service` and `message-service` services are functioning correctly and that there is a connection between them.

To verify the correct operation of this task, the following will be verified:

- It is possible to verify that users exist or not using the HTTP endpoint of users: http://localhost:8080/user/all (previously done in task 1)
- It is possible to create users in the DB using the users HTTP endpoint: http://localhost:8080/user (previously done in task 1)
- It is possible to verify that messages exist or not using the HTTP endpoint of messages: http://localhost:8181/message/all
- You can create new messages using the HTTP message endpoint: http://localhost:8181/message


**To complete this task it will be necessary to code the .proto file for `message-service` and finish the method for creating new messages in `message-service`.**

**In future tasks, you will need to come back here and note that a user must be subscribed to notifications by default once it is created. The app must verify it.**

**Detailed information on how to create a message**:

- **Method**: `POST`
- **URL**: `/message`
- **Request body**(JSON):
    ```json
    {
        "userSenderId": 1,
        "userReceiverId": 2,
        "body": "Hello! This is a test message."
    }
    ```
- **Responses**:
    - **Status Code**: `201 Created`
        - **Response body**:
        ```json
        {
            "id": 1,
            "userSenderId": 1,
            "userReceiverId": 2,
            "body": "Hello! This is a test message.",
            "sentAt": "2025-01-21T15:23:30"
        }
        ```
    - **Status Code**: `404 Not Found`
        - **Scenario**: `userSenderId` or `userReceiverId` does not exist.


#### Task 3

Task 3 aims to implement the communication between the `Notification - Service` and the `Frontend - Service`.

Every time a new message is created, the `Message - Service` pushes a new notification to the `Notification - Service` only if the user that receives the message is subscribed (by default). The `Notification - Service` has to then send the notification message to the `Frontend - Service` (the device).

The objective is to implement the method that receives the `Notification - Service` from the `Message - Service` and pass it over the `Frontend - Service`.

This method should:
- Create a new notification.
- Push the notification to the frontend service via gRPC.
- Set the `notificationArrived` attribute to the response of the pushed notification.
- Save the new notification into database.

**To complete this task it will be necessary to code the .proto file for `notification-service` and code the files [NotificationProtoService.java](/notification-service/src/main/java/io/nuwe/technical/api/grpc/NotificationProtoService.java) and [GrpcClientService.java](/notification-service/src/main/java/io/nuwe/technical/api/grpc/GrpcClientService.java)**

In addition, to be considered fully done, both notification-service and frontend-service endpoints will be tested. In this way it is checked if gRPC has been properly configured.

## ❓ Guides

Make sure to read the codebase. It provides with a lot of function that will help you develop the API. 

This project contains 4 + 1 different repositories, each of one has an specific function. These repositories follow the Microservices design. The repositories are:

- **User**: The user repository found as `user-service/`, whose only function is to manage users. It defines a basic CRD for Users. 
	- **HTTP**: It exposes an HTTP server (backend) to manage the users.
	- **gRPC**: It exposes an gRPC server (backend) to retireve user information.

- **Message**: The message repository found as `message-service/`, whose function is to send and retrieve messages between users. 
	- **HTTP**: It exposes an HTTP server (backend) to manage the users.
	- **gRPC**: It exposes an gRPC server (backend) to send and retreive messages.

- **Notification**: The notification repository found as `notification-service/`, whose only function is send notification to user device.
	- **HTTP**: It exposes an HTTP server (backend) to list all the notifications send and its state.
	- **gRPC**: It exposes an gRPC server (backend) to push notifications.
    
- **Frontend**: The frontend, a server simulating a frontend device, found as `frontend-grpc-service/` it serves as a testing device to check the notification system.
    - **HTTP**: It exposes an HTTP server to list all the notifications using the frontend service to check the correct functioning and communication between notification and frontend
	- **gRPC**: It exposes an gRPC server (backend) that accepts notifications.

Finally, there is another repository called `proto-definition/`. This repository contains the definition of the Protobuffers used in the gRPC server/clients among all the projects. It is a MUST dependency of all projects listed above.


Here is a the table of ports used in each service:

| **Service**             | **HTTP** | **gRPC** |
|-------------------------|----------|----------|
| `user-service`          | 8080     | 9797     |
| `message-service`       | 8181     | 9696     |
| `notification-service`  | 8282     | 9898     |
| `frontend-grpc-service` | 8031     | 3030     |
|-------------------------|----------|----------|

**ATTENTION**: You are not allowed to install 3rd party modules nor create new files. Modify only existing files. Everything else is already provided.

### How to run, compile & deliver

It is very important to read this part well as it contains crucial information for a correct correction of the challenge.

The file [build.sh](./build.sh) contains the commands that you will have to execute whenever you want to compile your code.

The following commands will be executed in the correction:

```bash
#Run User service 
java -jar user-service/target/technical.api-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar &

# Run the Message service 
java -jar message-service/target/technical.api-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar &

# Run the Notification service 
java -jar notification-service/target/technical.api-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar &

# Run the Frontend service 
java -jar frontend-grpc-service/target/technical.api-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar &
```

**Therefore, you should always deliver an updated version of the binaries. To do this, just run `build.sh` before pushing the code and verify that all the `.jar files` have been created in their respective projects inside `/target`.**

**It is also very important that you check if the .jar has been created for the `/proto-definition` project, as this is the one that creates the library needed for the rest of the projects.**

**IMPORTANT NOTE: In case of receiving a 0 in the score even though tasks have been completed, it may be due to a misconfiguration of gRPC or that one of the dependent projects has not compiled correctly.**

### Database

In this case, we will use a dockerised version of MySQL for the correction.

You can use MySQL in any way you want as long as you respect the configuration provided.

In case you want to use a container like ours, run the following command:

```bash
docker network create services_network

docker run -d \
  --name mysql \
  --network services_network \
  -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=getthemall \
  -e MYSQL_DATABASE=technical_api \
  -e MYSQL_USER=user \
  -e MYSQL_PASSWORD=getthemall \
  -p 3306:3306 \
  --restart always \
  mysql:8.0
```

**It is very important not to modify any path specified in the project.**
